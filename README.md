## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to understand factors that influenced passenger survival. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and detailed visualizations to reveal key insights.

**What I did:**
- ✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing
- ✅ Exploratory data analysis with statistical summaries
- ✅ Data visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Gender:** Women had 74% survival rate vs 19% for men
- **Class:** First-class passengers (63% survival) had much better chances than third-class (24% survival)
- **Age:** Children under 16 had higher survival probability
- **Family Size:** Passengers with small families (2-4 members) survived more than those traveling alone
- **Fare:** Higher ticket prices strongly correlated with survival
